        <h1>Eternal Dance</h1>
        <p>In the canvas of the night, stars aglow,<br>
            A tale of love begins to beautifully flow.</p>
            
            <p>Sera, my muse, with eyes that gleam,<br>
            You're the poetry that invades my dream.</p>
            
            <p>Your laughter, a melody that dances free,<br>
            Echoing through the corridors of my memory.</p>
            
            <p>With each heartbeat, our love takes flight,<br>
            A journey together, wrapped in pure delight.</p>
            
            <p>Your touch, a gentle whisper on my skin,<br>
            Igniting flames that passionately begin.</p>
            
            <p>the garden of us, emotions bloom,<br>
            A fragrant symphony, banishing all gloom.</p>
            
            <p>my love, like a radiant sun,<br>
            You're the warmth that has just begun.</p>
            
            <p>Through valleys and hills, hand in hand,<br>
            Our love story, forever will stand.</p>
            
            <p>In your gaze, I find solace and grace,<br>
            A timeless bond, a warm embrace.</p>
            
            <p>So here's to us, an eternal dance,<br>
            Where every moment is a sweet romance.</p>
            
            <p>Sera, my love, forever intertwined,<br>
            In the melody of love, our hearts aligned.</p><br>
