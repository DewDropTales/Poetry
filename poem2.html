        <h1>Echoes of Love</h1>
        <p>In the depths of longing's plea,<br>
        I yearn for moments that used to be.</p>

        <p>With a heart so heavy, I must confess,<br>
        "I miss you dearly", my heart's distress.</p>

        <p>In darkness, I faltered, I know it's true,<br>
        Not an excuse for the pain I put you through.</p>

        <p>Yet love endures, a year's embrace,<br>
        "I still love you," whispered with grace.</p>

        <p>One last kiss, a fervent plea,<br>
        I'd do anything to make it be.</p><br>
