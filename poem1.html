        <h1>Alice's Radiance</h1>
        <p>Alice, now my love, an enchanting song,<br>
        Our hearts entwined, where we both belong.</p>

        <p>Yesterday's confession paved the way,<br>
        A love story unfolding, bright as day.</p>

        <p>In your embrace, my world takes flight,<br>
        A symphony of joy, pure and bright.</p>

        <p>Your smile, a sunrise, a tender grace,<br>
        Illuminating love in every embrace.</p>

        <p>Together we dance, a graceful pair,<br>
        Navigating life with love to spare.</p>

        <p>Alice, my love, forever true,<br>
        In your eyes, a universe anew.</p>

        <p>Hand in hand, through valleys and peaks,<br>
        Our love, a journey, the heart speaks.</p>

        <p>With you, every moment feels so sweet,<br>
        In your love, my heart finds its beat.</p>

        <p>Alice, my love, a dream come true,<br>
        Forever and always, I belong to you.</p><br>
