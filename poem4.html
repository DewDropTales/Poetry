        <h1>Alice's Embrace</h1>
        <p>Alice, my first friend in school's embrace,<br>
        In your presence, my heart finds a sacred space.</p>

        <p>For a while, you stood as my only one,<br>
        A bond cherished, like the setting sun.</p>

        <p>Gratitude fills my heart for you,<br>
        A connection deep, strong, and true.</p>

        <p>Now, a confession I must unveil,<br>
        Feelings blossoming, emotions set sail.</p>

        <p>In the tapestry of time, you're woven,<br>
        A love for you, silently but unbroken.</p>

        <p>Your talk, a melody, sweet and clear,<br>
        Each word, a note that I hold dear.</p>

        <p>The way you walk, a graceful dance,<br>
        Leaving my heart in a sweet romance.</p>

        <p>Your caring soul, a gentle stream,<br>
        In the vastness of love, a cherished dream.</p>

        <p>Your smile, a sunrise that lights the night,<br>
        A beacon that makes everything feel right.</p>

        <p>And there you stand, in a constant place,<br>
        A steadfast presence, a familiar grace.</p>

        <p>Alice, do you feel what I do?<br>
        In your heart, is there a love that's true?</p>

        <p>Let our emotions intertwine and blend,<br>
        A love story waiting to ascend.</p>

        <p>I adore you in every subtle art,<br>
        Alice, you have my beating heart.</p><br>
